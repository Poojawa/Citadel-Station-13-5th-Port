MAKE SURE TO INSTALL BEFORE RUNNING THE BATCH FILES LABELED 1 AND 2, THERE'S AN INSTALLATION GUIDE, OR YOU CAN JUST RUN 'git_merge_installer.bat'.

RUN '1prepare_map.bat', then make your changes to the maps. Once you're finished, run '2clean_maps.bat'.
Then make your PR/commits and you're all set. 

~~~IF THE PROGRAM HANGS, GIVE IT A LOT OF TIME. CANCELLING THE PROCESS WILL CORRUPT YOUR MAP FILE AND YOU'LL NEED TO START OVER AGAIN! IT NORMALLY WILL RECOVER AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.~~~
